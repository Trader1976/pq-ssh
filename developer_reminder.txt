We are continuing development of pq-ssh, a Qt/C++ SSH client with post-quantum experiments.

Key facts:
- Language: C++17 + Qt (Widgets)
- SSH backend: libssh
- Terminal: QTermWidget + custom TerminalView
- Project has an ARCHITECTURE.md that describes the structure
- We already heavily commented these files:
  - DilithiumKeyCrypto.{h,cpp}
  - KeyGeneratorDialog.{h,cpp}
  - SshClient.{h,cpp}
  - SshShellWorker.{h,cpp}
  - TerminalView.{h,cpp}
  - ProfileStore.{h,cpp}
  - ProfilesEditorDialog.{h,cpp}
  - ThemeInstaller.cpp
- Current state:
  - Dilithium keys are encrypted at rest using libsodium (Argon2id + XChaCha20-Poly1305)
  - Dilithium is NOT used for SSH authentication yet
  - Key installation only uploads OpenSSH-style public keys
  - No DNA-identity logic yet (intentionally postponed)

Goal for this session:
<write what you want to do now>
